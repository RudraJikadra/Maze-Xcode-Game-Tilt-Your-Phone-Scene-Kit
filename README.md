# Maze-Xcode-Game-Tilt-Your-Phone-Scene-Kit
A Simple Maze Game where you have to control a box by tilting your phone in order to touch another box.
It uses Sprite Kit, Gameplay Kit, and Core Motion for building this game. And also Accelerometer in order to scan the tilt motion.

## Note 
This was built with Xcode 9 and Swift 4
In the gif below the cube moves when the phone is tilt, as if the gravity is acted upon the cube.
